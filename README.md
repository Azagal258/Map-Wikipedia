Hi,

This is a small side project that I'm doing while doing my regular class.  
The objective of the project is to graph the entirety of Wikipedia for extracting informations.  
The code in main branch *should* work in a more simple way (I did last time I tried it ^-^') as it will just use .csv as outputs.  

I'm currently trying to add save points in the code so that I don't have to rerun everything every time it fails or when I want to update the dumps. (^-^')>   
If you want to propose some help please say so.  

You'll need a running MySQL DB and to make a small .env file in your repo to store the values for host, user, password and database that you use. (for "SQL-DB-creation" branch's code) 
Also you'll need to use any software that use .cvs or databases for rendering the graph (Gephi, for example).
